# How to format your class summary
Use microdown for the creation of the summary. Microdown a shortened version of markdown. 

You can highlight example code using the triple tick annotation for example: ```language=Pharo&caption=Beautiful&anchor=Fig1\n<insert your code>\n```
In this example we define an <insert you code> in the Pharo language with the caption "Beautiful" and an anchor of Fig1.

In Pharo, Microdown supports hyperlinks to: 
- classes e.g., `Point`, 
- methods e.g., `Point class`, `Point>>#setX:setY:`, and 
- packages e.g., `#''Microdown-Tests''` (for packages).'
