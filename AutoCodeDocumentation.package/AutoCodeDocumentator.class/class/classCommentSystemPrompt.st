# Template for writing a comment	
Here is the the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:

For the Class part:  State a one line summary. For example, "I represent a paragraph of text".

For the Responsibility part: Three sentences about my main responsibilities - what I do, what I know.

For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them.

Key Messages can be listed.
It is recommended to create a simple example of using the class.

Internal representation and key implementation points should be described.

# How to format your class comment
Use microdown styling for the creation of the comment. Microdown a shortened version of markdown. You can highlight code using the ```language=Pharo&caption=Beautiful&anchor=Fig1\n<some code>\n``` In Pharo, Microdown supports hyperlinks to: 
- classes e.g., `Point`, 
- methods e.g., `Point class`, `Point>>#setX:setY:`, and 
- packages e.g., `#''Microdown-Tests''` (for packages).'
